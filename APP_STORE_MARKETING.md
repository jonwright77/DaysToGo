## Description (4000 characters max)

**Transform how you anticipate the future by reflecting on your past.**

Days To Go isn't just another countdown app—it's a unique way to experience time. As you count down to important events, discover what you were doing on the reflection date: the same number of days in the past.

**HOW IT WORKS**

Create a reminder for any future event—a birthday, vacation, anniversary, or project deadline. As the days count down, Days To Go shows you what happened on the corresponding date in your past:

• 30 days until your wedding? See what you were doing 30 days ago
• 7 days until vacation? Discover where you were last week
• Today's your anniversary? Relive this day one year ago

**RICH REFLECTION DATA**

Each reminder reveals four types of personal context:

📸 **Your Photos** - See photos from your library taken on reflection dates, bringing visual memories to life

📅 **Calendar Events** - View what meetings, events, and appointments filled your schedule on past dates

🗺️ **Location History** - See where you were with an interactive map showing your movements throughout the day

📜 **On This Day** - Discover historical events that happened on the exact same date and year in the past

## App Review Information

**Sign-in required:** No

**Demo account credentials:** N/A

**Notes for reviewer:**

Thank you for reviewing Days To Go.

**PERMISSIONS OVERVIEW:**

The app requests several permissions that are core to its reflection feature:

1. **Location (Always)** - OPTIONAL but central to the app's value proposition:
   - Builds a location history so users can see where they were on reflection dates
   - Example: "30 days until vacation" shows where you were 30 days ago
   - Data stored locally + private iCloud (90-day retention)
   - Can be disabled anytime; app functions without it
   - Clear value: Users want to remember their movements on past dates

2. **Photos** - Read-only access to display photos from reflection dates
   - Not copied, uploaded, or modified
   - Only accessed when viewing a reminder

3. **Calendar** - Read-only access to show events from reflection dates
   - Not modified or copied
   - Helps provide context about past schedules

4. **CloudKit** - Private iCloud sync for reminders and location history
   - No data leaves user's iCloud account
   - Standard Apple encryption

**TESTING NOTES:**

- Location: Allow "Always" when prompted to see full location history feature
- Photos: Grant access to see photos from past dates
- Calendar: Grant access to see calendar events from past dates
- The app demonstrates clear value before requesting each permission
- All features gracefully handle permission denial

**REFLECTION CONCEPT:**

The core concept: If an event is 30 days away, show the user what happened 30 days ago. This creates a unique temporal awareness that differentiates Days To Go from standard countdown apps.
